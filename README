Splam
=====

Splam is a simple spam scoring plugin.  It contains a set of rules that are run on a field
to determine the likelihood of that field being spam.

Check out the tests for instructions on how to use: you'll want to integrate this into
your application's workflow.

It's heavily biased towards the spam I've been seeing in the past two or three hours.
This includes lots of crap with
- bbcode [url=
- lots of links (http://)
- russian text
- links to russian or chinese websites

You can write your own plugins to Splam: simply subclass Splam::Rule. Splam is clever enough
to iterate over all Rule's subclasses and run the 'run' method on the field to be checked.
It aggregates all the scores.  From the brief testing I've done, anything over about 40 is
likely to be spam.  Real spam will blow out of the scoring stratosphere with over 1,000.

Recommended serving directions:

Add this to a model, check the score, and determine (based on other factors such as logged-in
user, time spent on the page, validity of request headers, length of user's membership on the 
site) whether to ban the post or not. 

We recommend showing the post to the user (sandbox them in) but hide it from everyone else.

Plans for the future:

1. Integrate bayesian or other clever checking, so that scores aren't hardcoded.
2. Write more plugins!
3. Test against a larger Ham corpus
