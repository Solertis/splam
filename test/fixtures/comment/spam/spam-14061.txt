There was this guy see.
He wasn't very bright and he reached his adult life without ever having learned "the facts".
Somehow, it gets to be his wedding day.
While he is walking down the isle, his father tugs his sleeve and says,

"Son, when you get to the hotel room...Call me"

Hours later he gets to the hotel room with his beautiful blushing bride and he calls his father,

"Dad, we are the hotel, what do I do?"

"O.K. Son, listen up, take off your clothes and get in the bed, then she should take off her clothes and get in the bed, if not help her. Then either way, ah, call me"

A few moments later...

"Dad we took off our clothes and we are in the bed, what do I do?"

O.K. Son, listen up. Move real close to her and she should move real close to you, and then... Ah, call me."

A few moments later...

"DAD! WE TOOK OFF OUR CLOTHES, GOT IN THE BED AND MOVED REAL CLOSE, WHAT DO I DO???"

"O.K. Son, Listen up, this is the most important part. Stick the long part of your body into the place where she goes to the bathroom."

A few moments later...

"Dad, I've got my foot in the toilet, what do I do?"
